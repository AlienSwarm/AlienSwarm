Play Information
----------------

                Phalanx Campaign for Alien Swarm (UT2004 mod)


"The Space Station Phalanx is one of the many institutes ran by the wide-spread SynTek Megacorporation.
Located in the Luyten system, the station houses many facilities, including research laboratories and large 
information databanks.

We know very little about the research operations here, but we do know they have been experimenting largely with
organic life forms, including Plants, various Earth-found animals, and even specimens from the Swarm.

72 hours ago contact with the station collapsed. SynTek have made no comment about the incident, but we have now 
been forced to take action.

The IAF have been called up to investigate the station, and find any data on the incident. We believe this to be
a case of Swarm infestation, proceed with extreme caution."

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instalation:

Extract to your Alien Swarm directory, making sure that "Use Folder Names" is turned on.

After installation, start the game using the Custom Campaign mutator (version 1.40 or later, included in the zip.)

For Singleplayer, run the "New_Phalanx_Campaign.bat" which will load Alien Swarm straight into the lobby, and the 
"Load_Phalanx_Campaign.bat" to load the game. Currently there can only be one game at a time.

For those wishing to host a server, consult the Custom Campaign Mutator readme included in the .zip.

Enjoy!

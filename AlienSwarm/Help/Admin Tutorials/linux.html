	<h1>Alien Swarm for Linux</h1>
	
	<div id="content">
	<p>This tutorial will try to describe shortly how to install Alien Swarm for Linux. It will also give information on how 
	to run a dedicated server from bash, making sure it restarts if it crashes and which ports you need to open on your firewall 
	to make it run properly.</p>
	
	<h2 id="installing">Installing Alien Swarm</h2>
	
	<p>Make sure you have Unreal Tournament 2004 installed. Doesn't matter where. (It resides in 
	<var>/opt/ut2004</var> for me.)</p>
	<p>Then make sure you download and install 
	<a href="http://download.beyondunreal.com/fileworks.php/official/ut2004/ut2004-lnxpatch3204.tar.bz2" 
	title="Download the latest patch from beyondunreal.com">patch 3204 </a>.</p> 
	
	<p>If you downloaded the non-umod file, then unzip the contens of the zip package to the <var>/ut2004/</var> directory so Alien Swarm will be in
	it's on directory, <var>/ut2004/AlienSwarm</var> and run the executable script which is described a little more down below.</p>
	
	<p>If you downloaded the umod version of the file, unzip the contents to a temporary directory and copy the <var>AlienSwarm_v1.ut4mod</var> and <var>as-linux-installer.sh</var> files to <var>/ut2004/System/</var> then
	open a terminal and type <kbd>sh ./as-linux-installer.sh</kbd> in the directory <var>/ut2004/System/</var> and 
	the installer will unpack Alien Swarm.</p>
	
	<p>You can also <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/liflg/alien.swarm_1.0-english.run" title="Download the graphical installer for Linux. Total size of download is 99MB.">download a graphical installer</a> for Linux which is made by <a href="http://liflg.sourceforge.net/" title="A site made by a few people that make installers for games. Be it native ports or run via WineX emulation.">Loki Installers for Linux Gamers</a>. To run it, just type <kbd>sh alien.swarm_1.0-english.run</kbd>.</p>
	<p>(Note: This installer comes with a different executable, you need to type <kbd>./alienswarm</kbd> instead of the command below to run AS.)</p>
	
	<p>To run Alien Swarm, execute the Swarm Linux executable by typing <kbd>sh ./Alien-Swarm-Linux</kbd> when you are
	in the <var>/ut2004/System/</var> directory.</p>
	
	
	
	<h2 id="ports">Opening server ports</h2>
	
	<p>The default ports are:</p>
	
	<table summary="ports and their explanation">
		<tbody>
			<tr>
			  <th scope="col">Port</th>
			  <th scope="col">Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr><td>7777 <abbr title="User Datagram Protocol">UDP</abbr>/IP</td><td>Game Port</td></tr>
			<tr><td>7778 UDP/IP</td><td>Query Port</td></tr>
			<tr><td>7787 UDP/IP</td><td>GameSpy uplink</td></tr>
			<tr><td>28902 <abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</abbr>/IP</td><td>Master Server uplink</td></tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	
	<p>If you are using <a href="http://www.iptables.org/" title="IPtables, an IP packet filter administration program">IPtables</a> you 
	can use these commands to open ports to your server(make sure you are root before you enter these commands.):</p>
	
	<p class="mark">
	iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p udp -m multiport --dport 7777,7778,7787 -j ACCEPT<br />
	iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 28902 -j ACCEPT<br />
	</p>
	
	<p>If you are using <a href="http://shorewall.net" title="Shorewall, another IP packet filter administration program">Shorewall</a> 
	can add these two lines to your <var>/etc/shorewall/rules</var> file:</p>
	
	<p class="mark">
	ACCEPT         net             fw        udp   7777,7778,7787,7788<br />
	ACCEPT         net             fw        tcp   28902<br />
	</p>
	
	<p>Note: You don't need to open 28902 and 7787 if you don't intend to run an advertised server. If you want to run the 
	webadmin client, you should open another port for this, for example, tcp port 8888. Don't forget to add this port number 
	to your AlienSwarm.ini file.</p>
	
	
	
	<h2 id="server-commands">Starting an Alien Swarm Linux dedicated server from the command line</h2>
	
	<p>If you want to run a dedicated server without having to use the Graphical menus, you can use the following commands in a terminal.</p>
	
	<p>To start a new campaign server use:</p>
	<p class="mark"><kbd>./ucc-bin server AOL-CampaignLobby.ut2?CampaignSlot=#?NewGame=Yes?SlotName=$ -mod=AlienSwarm</kbd></p>
	
	<p>The hash (#) in the above command is a number between 0 and 11 and the dollar sign is the name for your slot.</p>
	
	<p>To resume the previously played campaign game. Where hash (#) is the slotnumber of the game you want to restore:</p>
	<p class="mark"><kbd>./ucc-bin server AOL-CampaignLobby.ut2?CampaignSlot=#?NewGame=No -mod=AlienSwarm</kbd></p>
	
	<p>If you just want to make the server play a single map, you can use:</p>
	<p class="mark"><kbd>./ucc-bin server <var>map-name</var> -mod=AlienSwarm</kbd></p>
	
	<p>Note: The <kbd>ucc-bin</kbd> commands must be executed from the <var>ut2004/System</var> directory. If you prefer <em>not</em> 
	to use an ordinary user for running your server you could use the tag <kbd>-nohomedir</kbd> after the start-up commands. This 
	prevents directory creation in your Home directory. Alien Swarm will then use the settings it finds in <var>/AlienSwarm/System/</var>.</p>
	
	<h3 id="custom-ini-files">Using custom ini files</h3>
	
	<p>If you want to use custom ini files, for use with two or more servers on one machine, you can use the following command to point to these ini files.</p>
	
	<p class="mark"><kbd>./ucc-bin server <var>map-name</var> -ini=../AlienSwarm/System/AlienSwarm.ini -userini=../AlienSwarm/System/AlienSwarmUser.ini</kbd></p>
	
	<h3 id="restart-script">Restart script</h3>
	
	<p>When an UT2004 server crashes, it doesn't restart by itself. So I will provide you with a little script that does
	this for you. To make the script follow these short steps:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Open a terminal window and go to the <var>/ut2004/AlienSwarm/</var> directory.</li>
	  <li>Type <kbd>touch start-service</kbd></li>
	  <li>Type <kbd>chmod +x start-service</kbd></li>
	  <li>Then open <var>start-service</var> in a text editor and copy and paste the following text:
	  
	  <p class="mark"><code>#!/bin/sh<br />
	  GAMEPATH=/path/to/where/you/installed/ut2004/<br />
	  <br />
	  while true<br />
	  do<br />
	  ${GAMEPATH}./ucc-bin server AO-ReactorCore.ut2 -mod=AlienSwarm -nohomedir<br />
	  echo "Server crashed on " >> ${GAMEPATH}/crash.log<br />
	  echo `date +%Y-%m-%d_%H.%M` >> ${GAMEPATH}/crash.log<br />
	  done<br /></code></p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Change the <code>GAMEPATH=</code> part to match where you installed ut2004</li>
	  <li>Save this file and exit the editor program.</li>
	  <li>Then type <kbd>sh ./start-service</kbd> to start the server.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>You could edit the game type in this script to make it run a campaign server. Or you could let it restart as a single map 
	game server, since people can always vote to start a new campaign, this game is stored in the last slot (slot 11). It gets overwriten 
	when someone calls a vote to start a new campaign.</p>
	
	<a href="#top" title="To the top of this document.">&uarr; top</a>
	
	<h2 id="server-settings">Changing server settings</h2>
	
	<p>There are two ways to change settings for your server:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>You use the menu that you can access in-game. Best use this for setting up a server quickly.</li>
	  <li>You can edit ini files for more control.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>First I'll explain about the server settings menu you can find in-game.</p>
	<a href="server-settings-screen.jpg"><img src="server-settings-screen_small.jpg" alt="Server settings screenshot. Click to enlarge." />
	<br />Enlarged version of this screenshot.</a>
	
	<p>When you access this menu (Host Multiplayer &rarr; Server settings) you get shown a few options. What you need to fill in here 
	should also be pretty obvious (hopefully!) but I'll go through it anyway.</p> 
	
	<dl>
	  <dt>Server name</dt> <dd>The name that will show up in the server browser</dd>
	  <dt>Admin name</dt> <dd>Your name or nickname.</dd>
	  <dt>Admin password</dt> <dd>The password that you enter to become administrator.</dd>
	  <dt>Admin email</dt> <dd>The email adress you want to give out to people so they can send you emails about possible problems they 
	  may have with your server.</dd>
	  <dt>Game password</dt> <dd>If you put a password in this field, people need to enter a password if they want to access your server. 
	  Leave blank, if you want to allow anyone to come in your server.</dd>
	  <dt>Advertise server</dt> <dd>What this option does is basically make your server show up in the server browser.</dd>
	  <dt>Allow midgame Joins</dt> <dd>Switch this on if you want people to be able to enter midgame. They cannot select a marine yet and 
	  have to spectate for as long as the round lasts.</dd>
	  <dt>Max players</dt> <dd>The game defaults to 6 players max, though this can be increased to 8 if you have the bandwidth.  We 
	  recommend games of 4&#8211;6 players for gameplay purposes, any more than that and it tends to get very crowded with a loss of teamwork.</dd>

	<h2 id="alienswarm"><code>AlienSwarm.ini</code></h2>
	
	<p>Now for the more advanced stuff. Tweaking your AlienSwarm.ini file. Either your home directory or 
	(if you used the <kbd>-nohomedir</kbd> switch) the <var>ut2004/System</var> directory.</p>
	
	<p>I will provide samples sections from AlienSwarm.ini here and describe what the settings do in each section.</p>

	<dt>SendStats</dt>
	<dd>This will send stats to a stats server, but Alien Swarm does not support this so it's currently useless.</dd>
	
	<dt>ServerBehindNAT</dt>
	<dd>Try setting this to true if your server is behind a NAT/MASQ router and people are having problems connecting to your server.</dd>
	
	<dt>DoLANBroadcast</dt>
	<dd>This makes the server show up under the LAN tab for other pc's on your lan if true.</dd>

	<dd>This sets the difficulty of the current game. You can set a difficulty of 1 up to 10. More difficulty affects alien

	<dt>bCameraPrediction</dt>
	<dd>This makes the server anticipate the camera panning of players, setting it to false will save bandwidth but will result

	<a href="#top" title="To the top of this document.">&uarr; top</a>
	
	
	<h2 id="notes">Additional notes</h2>
	
	<ul>
	   <li>You might experience problems with starting a dedicated server from the graphical menus, a listen server works fine though. We 
	   recommend that you use a terminal to start a dedicated server. (This is most likely an UT2004 bug and we are currently investigating 
	   the possible cause.)</li>
	   <li>If you place a new custom map in <var>AlienSwarm/Maps</var> and start the server, it will export the map and try to start the 
	   server or client. On the linux client when it exports the map and tries to start the game it will crash with an error saying 
	   something like: 
	   <p class="mark">
		foo@foobar System $ <kbd>sh ./Alien-Swarm-Linux</kbd><br />
		<samp>Exporting AO-{mapname}.....Successful!<br />
		WARNING: ALC_EXT_capture is subject to change!<br />
		_X11TransSocketOpen: socket() failed for local<br />
		_X11TransSocketOpenCOTSClient: Unable to open socket for local<br />
		_X11TransOpen: transport open failed for local/{your-hostname}:0<br />
		pause_audiodevice stubbed for 0x3<br />
		pause_audiodevice stubbed for 0x3<br />
		Couldn't set video mode: Could not create GL context<br />
		<br />
		History:<br />
		Exiting due to error</samp><br />
	   </p>
	   <p>This is possibly a Linux UT2004 bug because it doesn't happen for the windows version. Should it crash, just restart it again and 
	   it will start up as normal.</p>
	   </li>
	   <li>The webadmin can be used, but it's not customized for Alien Swarm. You can still use it to say stuff to players in game, kick 
	   &amp; ban players, restart the server,etc.</li>
	   <li>If you get an error saying something like:
	   <p class="mark">
	   <samp>Failed to enter AlienSwarmStartup.ut2: Can't find file 'AlienSwarmStartup.ut2'<br />
	   <br />
	   History:<br />
	   <br />
	   Exiting due to error<br /></samp>
	   </p>
	   then you didn't patch ut2004 to version 3204. Version 3204 alters the way the ini files handles paths and Alien Swarm uses the new path handling. If you get this error, you need to delete <var>AlienSwarm.ini</var>, then patch and restart the mod. Then it should work as normal.</li>
	   <li>If you have a server that can use multiple IPs you can use the <kbd>-multihome=</kbd> switch in the ucc-bin command line to tell ucc which IP to use for this server. If you are looking for more information about how to run multiple servers on one machine, there is <a href="http://www.unrealadmin.org/forums/showthread.php?t=36#MultipleInternet" title="More information about how to run multiple servers on one machine.">a detailed guide</a> on unrealadmin.org</li>
	   <li>In Alien Swarm v1, some additional ini files were used (AoServer.ini, AoCampaignGame.ini, AoBestScores.ini), however in 1.1 and above, all these settings were moved into the AlienSwarm.ini to support multiple servers on one machine.</li>

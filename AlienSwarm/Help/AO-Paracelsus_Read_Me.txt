System Requirements	: created on a 1.8G/1024MB RAM machine.
			  Map performance has about retail standard, maybe a notch more demanding.

Objectives		: Target codename: Paracelsus. Intelligence has traced several suspicious SynTec shipments of 					  contraband bio materials to this location, the last shipment supposedly containing an unknown 				  number of life swarm eggs. By government law 82-4a this action classifies as high treason and 				  allows us to nuke the site from orbit if required.

			  You are to lead a small reconnaisance strike force to evaluate the threat level inside the 					  facility, retrieve as much research data and information on SynTec's recent activities as possible. 			  Once the files are transmitted, sabotage the reactor controls and get the hell out before you are 				  vaporized, along with a square mile of landscape.

This map is copyrighted by PhCDonat, 2004. Feel free to abuse it though.
Authors might use this level as a base to build additional levels or convert it to other gametypes, mentioning of my name and notification would be appreciated though, as I'm a passionate, self centered egomaniac.

You are allowed to commercially exploit this level, i.e. put it on a CD or any other electronic medium that is sold for money only with an adequate share of the exploits transferred to my bank account... which I doubt to be significantly more than the Austrian transfer taxes anyway.

You MAY distribute this BSP through any electronic network (internet, FIDO, local BBS etc.), provided you include this file and leave the archive intact. If you don't I'll cast upon you the dreadful voodoo spell of the neverending itch between the shoulder blades, where you can't scratch. Don't say you've not been warned.

Ao-LostContact-SE8

- UPDATED TO ALLOW 8 PLAYERS. A SLIGHT OVERSIGHT ON MY PART, AHEM...

Quick Description:

Your primary mission objective is to discover what has happened to the Delta complex on LZ12-02. 

An electrical storm has been raging for the past three days which has isolated the complex from sending 
or receiving any communications. Off-world sensors indicate that the storm cleared up at 0600 hours this morning, 
but still no communication has been received from the complex.
We want to know what is happening in there, so we are sending your squad to scout out the location and report 
back on the events that have taken place over the previous three days.

Lost Contact is a very large map with plenty of surprises. I have designed it so that no two games will play quite
the same... aliens will not always come from the same place. They may not come at all. Just when you think 
everything is safe because you've played this level 10 times before, you might just get jumped :-)

I recommend that you play this on normal difficulty in multiplayer, as there are many open areas in the map which makes gunning down hundreds of aliens pretty simple with several individually controlled marines.

I also recommend setting aside an afternoon to play this map, as it is rather large :-)

Update:

The SE version of this map is a little smaller than the first one, as I have chopped out the (admittedly) boring opening area.
I've tweaked the map to play a little better, with less empty areas, and more bug killing! 

The main changes are:

Enabling the generator is now optional, you can just blast through the doors instead if you so wish.
The welder is now far more useful, some doors and vents can only be opened if you weld them.
Extended one of the vents to make it more interesting and difficult
Longer hack times on several panels
More aliens and tweaked spawns
More Pickups (health, ammo etc)
Numerous bug fixes
Custom stim music and different escape music
More stuff you probably wont even notice...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known Bugs:

The AI occasionally get stuck on railings and other meshes. Just hang about for a second or take control of them to free them.

I have seen a problem whereby items dropped (ie ammo) disappear in terrain areas of the map. This only seems to 
happen if you are facing a steep incline. Unfortunately I don't know how to fix the problem and I assume it is 
something to do with the game mechanics. If you drop items in terrain areas, try to do it facing away from any
steep inclines!

If you are spectating a match, certain emitters will not appear or disappear as intended. They will do for anyone playing the game, but not for spectators. I can only assume this is something to do with the game as opposed to the map, and since it doesn't hamper the enjoyment of the game for the people playing it, I haven't looked into it much.

I'd like to thank the guys on #swarm.pickup for helping me beta test this monster. Oblivious for his never ending testing crusade, Carth, SirRobin, Sereal, Vigge and Fluffy for kindly letting me test the map on his server. Plus anyone else that i've carelessly forgotten ;)
Thanks guys!

Thanks to the swarm regulars for helping me test the SE version of this map, thx particularly to Carth who must be sick of this map by now!

Thanks for downloading Lost-Contact-SE8, I hope you enjoy it.
